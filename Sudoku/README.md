This program implements a sudoku solver in JavaScript. The algorithm first generates all the possible numbers for each missing solution by checking the existing numbers in the row, the column, and the 3x3 square to which the solution belongs. We then perform a depth-first search to traverse all the missing solutions and fill in the appropriate numbers. When we guess one of the possible values for each missing solution, we regenerate the possible values for all the missing solutions within its row, column, and 3x3 square to ensure that they do not contain the value that we guess. If the guessed value for one missing solution makes one of the other missing solutions run out of possible values, then we guess the next available value for that solution. Exhaustion of all the available values for a missing solution means that we have guessed the previous solutions incorrectly. In that case, we backtrack to the previous solution and guess the next available value for that solution. This process of checking for available values and backtracking is repeated until the all the missing solutions are filled.
